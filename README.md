# Cheat Sheets Collection

This repository is a curated collection of cheat sheets for various tools, operating systems, and concepts. It aims to serve as a quick reference guide for common commands, configurations, and best practices.

**Recent Improvements:** All cheat sheets in this repository have been recently reorganized, reviewed, and extensively commented for clarity and educational value.

## Overview of Cheatsheets

Here's a glimpse of the topics covered in this collection:

*   **`01-misc_cheatsheet.md`**: A comprehensive collection of miscellaneous system administration, command-line utilities, and various tool-specific snippets primarily for Linux-based systems.
*   **`02-gentoo_cheatsheet.md`**: Focuses on Gentoo Linux, covering Portage (its package manager), ebuilds, USE flags, system configuration with `eselect`, kernel management, and OpenRC services.
*   **`03-nixos_cheatsheet.md`**: Covers NixOS and the Nix package manager, detailing its declarative configuration approach (`configuration.nix`), `nixos-rebuild`, channels, Nix Flakes, and common Nix commands.
*   **`04-NixOS_ZFS-install.md`**: A step-by-step guide for installing NixOS with ZFS as the root filesystem, including partitioning, ZFS pool/dataset setup, and NixOS configuration for ZFS.
*   **`05-git_cheatsheet.md`**: A detailed guide to the Git version control system, covering core concepts, initial setup, basic workflow, branching, merging, rebasing, remotes, undoing changes, stashing, tagging, and more.
*   **`06-qemu_cheatsheet.md`**: Pertains to QEMU, the machine emulator and virtualizer, detailing `qemu-img` for disk management, `qemu-system-*` for VM launching, and options for CPU, memory, disk images, networking, display, and performance.
*   **`07-dorks.md`**: Explores search engine dorking techniques for security awareness, demonstrating how specific queries can find various types of information. Includes a strong ethical use disclaimer.
*   **`08-dorks_for_passwords.md`**: Specifically focuses on dorks related to potential password and credential exposure, with an extremely strong emphasis on ethical use, the illegality of unauthorized access, and its educational purpose for understanding data exposure risks.
*   **`09-zfs_cheatsheet.md`**: A comprehensive guide to the ZFS filesystem and volume manager, covering core concepts, pool management, dataset/zvol operations, properties, snapshots, clones, send/receive, caching (ARC, L2ARC), SLOG, and maintenance.
*   **`10-aircrack-ng_cheatsheet.md`**: Details the Aircrack-ng suite for Wi-Fi network security auditing. It covers enabling monitor mode, network discovery, packet capture, various attack types (with caveats), and password cracking, all prefaced by a critical ethical and legal use disclaimer.

## Important Note on Usage

While these cheat sheets aim to be informative and accurate:
*   The commands and configurations provided are for educational and quick reference purposes.
*   Some commands, especially those in security-focused cheatsheets (like dorks or Aircrack-ng), can be misused. **Always ensure you have explicit authorization before testing or using any potentially disruptive commands on systems or networks you do not own.**
*   The world of technology is ever-evolving. While efforts are made to keep information current, always cross-reference with official documentation for the latest best practices and command options.
*   Users are responsible for their own actions when using information from these cheatsheets.
